    <h3 class="other-site-title">Cars Without Limits Website</h3>
    <p class="other-site-info">This <a href="http://carswithoutlimits.com/" target="_blank">website</a> shows luxury cars, sports cars and more. What makes this a good site is that it is easy to navigate and it catches the user's attention. This site's navigation menu is on the side which is a little different. What I also like about this site is that it keeps the navigation menu on the side even when you click on the different links. This helps so the user won't have to scroll to the top for the menu.</p>
